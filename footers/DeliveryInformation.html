    <h4>Delivery Information</h4>

    <p>At Vibora UK, we aim to ensure that your padel equipment arrives quickly, safely, 
        and in excellent condition. All orders are processed as soon as possible, and we work hard to dispatch items promptly so that you can enjoy your purchase without unnecessary delays. The exact delivery time may vary depending on the products ordered, your location, and the time at which the order is placed, 
        but we always strive to provide a smooth and efficient delivery experience.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Once your order has been placed, it enters our processing system.
             Orders placed on weekends or public holidays may be processed on the next working day. After processing, your items will be handed to our delivery partners who handle the final transport of your goods. You will receive confirmation once your order has been dispatched,
             and tracking information may be provided where applicable so that you can follow the progress of your delivery.</p>

        
             <br>
        <p>Delivery charges are calculated based on the shipping destination, 
            total weight or size of the items, and the selected delivery method. All costs will be clearly displayed at checkout before you complete your purchase. Any promotions, free shipping offers, or delivery upgrades will be presented on the website when available. It is important that you provide accurate delivery information, 
            as we cannot be held responsible for delays or issues arising from incorrect addresses or missing details.</p>

        
        <br>
        <p>
           Estimated delivery times are provided to give you a general idea of when to expect your order, 
           but they are not guaranteed. Factors such as courier delays, weather conditions, seasonal volume, or other unforeseen circumstances may affect the actual delivery timeframe. We do not accept responsibility for delays that occur after your parcel has been handed to the courier, 
           although we will always assist you in tracking or resolving issues where possible. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the unlikely event that your order arrives damaged, incomplete,
             or with signs of tampering, please contact us as soon as possible. We recommend notifying us promptly so that we can investigate the matter and work with our delivery partners to reach a suitable resolution. 
            Photographic evidence may be required to help support any claims.
        </p>

        <p>
